// This JS File contains the function getExpressionDataJSONarray. 
// To use this function, pass it the arguments: cohortQuery and geneQuery. 
// The ouput is an array of JSON objects of the form:
/*
    {
      "cohort": string,
      "expression_log2": float,
      "gene": string,
      "geneID": int,
      "protocol": string,
      "sample_type": string,
      "tcga_participant_barcode": string,
      "z-score": float 
    }
*/
// Going forward, this array of JSONs will likely be the best data structure to use for plotting with d3
// The array is also sorted by tcga_participant_barcode, which can be thought of as an index for plotting and for 
// merging this data with other data types (such as mutation data) later on.

// Note: to use getExpressionDataJSONarray, you must set a variable equal to the result returned by the function,
// then use the .then(function(finalResult)) method to use the finalResult inside the Promise that is returned.

getExpressionDataJSONarray  = async function(cohortQuery, geneQuery) {
  var dataFetched = await fetchExpressionData(cohortQuery,geneQuery);
  var results = dataFetched.mRNASeq;

  return await results;
