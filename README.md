# [Web Genomics](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/webgen_~_web_genomics/)
Precision Medicine requires an ever growing Biomedical BigData reference. This growth is particularly striking for pathologies with a genomic basis, like Cancer. Accordingly, NIH/NCI has spearheaded the establishment of interoperable multi-petabyte sized Genomic Data Commons (gdc.cancer.gov) as a data ecosystem that the scientific community, including the citizen scientist, can populate with analytical applications. The goal of this project is to explore this new data-rich landscape by developing nimble Web Applications (Apps) that help find novel associations between genomic features and cancer phenotypes. For more information see [Stony Brook University VIP page](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/webgen_~_web_genomics/).

## Todo

1. Create gihub account, list you id with your name below.
2. Create a webgen doc at https://beta.observablehq.com.
3. Have a look at [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) as reference for JS leaning.
4. Start checking your fellow participant's notebooks and github activity.
5. Study [GDC](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/) (Genomics Data Commons) [API](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/) and note how easy it is to retieve data. So the next step is to start doing just that in the middle of your own notes. Have a [look at mine](https://beta.observablehq.com/@jonasalmeida/webgen).

____

Issues: Cancer Genomics, Web Technologies, JavaScript, Artificial Intelligence, scalable distributed computing, social coding, patient-centered cancer prevention and treatment.

Methods & Technologies: Web Technologies (JavaScript, Apps), Cancer Genomics, Computational Statistics, Artificial Intelligence, Precision Medicine

Disciplines: Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Informatics, Computer Engineering, Computer Science

Interests / Preparation by Major: Pre-existing knowledge of programming, particularly JavaScript, will be favored as it indicates an innate interest in social coding (user-facing application development). This is applicable to all students, regardless of focus being on Mathematics or Molecular Biology.
